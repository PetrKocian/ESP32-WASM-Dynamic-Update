# Simple UART Wasm Uploader
This folder contains a very simple uploader, that sends Wasm binary to `/dev/ttyUSB0`. The binary is loaded from `test_wasm.h`, which is compiled together with the source file.

Before sending the Wasm binary to `/dev/ttyUSB0`, it sends a sequence of characters: `STX` `w` `a` `s` `m` `US`, to signal to the listening device that the binary Wasm will be sent.

## Build and run

To build run: `gcc uart_sender.cpp -o uart_sender`

To change any parameters, edit the `uart_sender.cpp` source file

To change the Wasm binary, just overwrite the `test_wasm.h`
The content of the file is:
`unsigned char wasm_test_file[] = { ... };`

Such a file can be generated by [WAMR](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime/tree/main/product-mini/app-samples/hello-world) 


There are two precompiled executables that write a simple Wasm binary to `/dev/ttyUSB0`
